# 🌸 Markdown to HTML Converter

This is a small JavaScript project I built to practice text parsing, regular expressions, and DOM manipulation.  
The app takes Markdown input and dynamically converts it into raw HTML and a rendered preview.

## Features
- Live Markdown-to-HTML conversion  
- Support for:
  - Headings (`#` to `######`)
  - Blockquotes (`>`)
  - Bold (`**text**` or `__text__`)
  - Italic (`*text*` or `_text_`)
  - Links (`[text](url)`)
  - Images (`![alt](url)`)
- Raw HTML output panel  
- Live preview panel  
- Fully client-side, no libraries used
