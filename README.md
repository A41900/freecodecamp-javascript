# FreeCodeCamp – JavaScript Algorithms & Mini Projects

This repository contains my JavaScript exercises and mini projects developed while completing the **FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** certification.  
The goal is to strengthen my understanding of algorithms, problem-solving, and front-end fundamentals while building a clean, organized, and beginner-friendly coding portfolio.

## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔹 basic-algorithms/
Foundational exercises focused on logical reasoning, loops, math operations, and array/object manipulation.  
Examples:  
Smallest Common Multiple • Sum of Primes • Symmetric Difference • Sorting/Filtering • Pig Latin Translator

---

### 🔹 intermediate-algorithms/
Multi-step logic challenges and data-handling exercises.

Projects included:
- **Inventory Management System**
- **Voting System** (poll creation using Map & Set with validation)

---

### 🔹 mini-projects/
Interactive projects built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, focused on DOM manipulation and UI behavior:
