# FreeCodeCamp – JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains my solutions to the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.
The goal is to improve my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, problem-solving and algorithmic thinking while building a clean and organised coding portfolio.

## 📁 Structure

- **basic-algorithms** — simple algorithm challenges  
- **intermediate-algorithms** — more complex logic exercises (coming soon)  
- **functional-programming** — practice with map, filter, reduce (coming soon)  
- **projects** — the final certification projects (coming soon)

More challenges will be added as I progress.
