# FreeCodeCamp – JavaScript Algorithms & Mini Projects

This repository contains my solutions and practice exercises developed while completing the **FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** certification.  
The goal is to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and to build a clean and well-structured coding portfolio.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 🔹 **basic-algorithms/**
Introductory exercises focused on logic, loops, mathematical reasoning, and array/object manipulation.  
Examples include:
- Smallest common multiple  
- Sum of prime numbers  
- Symmetric difference between arrays  
- Filtering and sorting objects  

---

### 🔹 **intermediate-algorithms/**
More complex logic exercises involving CRUD operations, data handling, and multi-step reasoning.  
Current exercise:
- Inventory Management System

---

### 🔹 **mini-projects/**
Small interactive projects built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to practice DOM manipulation and real UI behavior.  
This folder includes:

- ⭐ **Favorite Icon Toggler**  
- ⚽ **Football Team Cards**  
- 📝 **Customer Complaint Form Validation**  
  - FreeCodeCamp project: HTML and CSS provided by the platform  
  - All JavaScript validation logic implemented by me  
  - Features: real-time validation, regex patterns, conditional field logic, and form submission handling  

*(More mini-projects will be added as I progress.)*

---

### 🔹 **functional-programming/**
Exercises using `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, and other functional programming concepts.  
*(coming soon)*

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as:

- a study hub for reinforcing core JavaScript skills  
- a record of my learning journey  
- part of my portfolio as I transition into the tech industry  
- a demonstration of consistency, problem-solving, and clean code practices

## 📝 Notes

All solutions and mini-projects are written by me while studying for the FreeCodeCamp certification.  
Some projects include HTML/CSS templates provided by FreeCodeCamp, but **all JavaScript logic is implemented by me** to practice structure, validation, and DOM manipulation.
