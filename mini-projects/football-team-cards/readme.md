# 🌸 Football Team Cards — Player Filter App

Mini application built with **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**, displaying team player cards and allowing filtering by position (forward, midfielder, defender, goalkeeper).
The goal is to practice DOM manipulation, dynamic element creation, events, and data filtering in arrays.

## Features

- Displays main team information: name, year, and head coach.
- Shows individual player cards.
- Interactive filter by position using a `<select>`.
- Highlights the team captain with special formatting.
- Demonstrates core JavaScript concepts:
  - `addEventListener()`
  - element creation (`createElement`)
  - `appendChild`
  - array filtering (`filter`)
  - dynamic DOM cleaning and updating
    
## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
