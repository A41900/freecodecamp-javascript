# 🌸 Bookmark Manager

A simple bookmark management application built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

This project allows users to save, view, and delete bookmarks by category using the browser’s **localStorage**.  
It was developed as a practice project to strengthen my understanding of **DOM manipulation, data persistence, and basic CRUD operations** in JavaScript.
