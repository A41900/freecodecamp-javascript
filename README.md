# FreeCodeCamp – JavaScript Algorithms & Mini Projects

This repository contains my solutions and practice exercises developed while completing the **FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** certification.  
The goal is to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and build a clean and well-structured coding portfolio.
