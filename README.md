# 🌸 FreeCodeCamp – JavaScript Algorithms & Mini Projects

This repository contains my JavaScript exercises and mini projects developed while completing the  
**FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** certification.

The main goal of this repository is to document my learning journey, strengthen my understanding of
**JavaScript fundamentals, algorithms, and DOM manipulation**, and provide a clear record of my progress
as I transition into the tech industry.

## Project Structure

### basic-algorithms/
Foundational exercises focused on logical reasoning, loops, mathematical operations, and
array/object manipulation.

Examples include:
- Smallest Common Multiple  
- Sum of Primes  
- Symmetric Difference  
- Sorting and Filtering Objects  
- Pig Latin Translator  

---

### intermediate-algorithms/
Multi-step logic challenges and data-handling exercises designed to reinforce structured thinking
and problem decomposition.

Projects included:
- **Inventory Management System**
- **Voting System** (poll creation using `Map` and `Set` with input validation)

---

### mini-projects/
Interactive projects built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, focused on DOM manipulation,
event handling, and UI behavior:

-  Bookmark Manager (CRUD operations with `localStorage`)
-  Favorite Icon Toggler  
-  Football Team Cards  
-  Customer Complaint Form (regex validation, dynamic styling)  
-  Markdown to HTML Converter (custom parser)  
-  Drum Machine (keyboard and click-based sound triggers)  
-  Weather App (API consumption, async logic, dynamic UI updates)

> Some of these projects were developed following the FreeCodeCamp curriculum structure,
> while all JavaScript logic was written, understood, and adapted by me.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- a documented learning archive of my FreeCodeCamp journey  
- a reference for JavaScript fundamentals and algorithms  
- evidence of consistent practice and project-based learning  
- a complementary part of my portfolio as a junior developer  

---

## Notes

All solutions and projects were written by me as part of my learning process.  
Some challenges provide starter HTML/CSS templates, but **all JavaScript logic and problem-solving
was implemented and understood by me**.
