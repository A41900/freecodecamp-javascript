## 🎯 Learning Purpose
This mini-project was created as part of my JavaScript practice to reinforce:

- DOM manipulation  
- Click event handling  
- Updating classes dynamically  
- Creating dynamic HTML content  

It is a simple but useful exercise to begin building interactive front-end features.
